# Fake-News-Detection

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of news articles classified as fake or real, applies text preprocessing, and trains multiple models to predict the authenticity of news articles.

## üìã Project Explanation and Key Features
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify news articles. The key features include:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   The text data is cleaned by removing URLs, special characters, punctuation, and numbers.

2. **Text Vectorization**  
   The cleaned text is transformed into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**, capturing important text features.

3. **Model Training**  
   Three machine learning models are used to classify the articles:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier

4. **Manual Testing**  
   Users can input their own news articles, and the system predicts whether they are fake or real.

5. **Accuracy Evaluation**  
   The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üöß Challenges Faced
1. **Data Preprocessing Issues:**  
   The dataset contained noisy text (e.g., URLs, special characters). I developed custom functions to clean the data effectively.

2. **Model Overfitting:**  
   Decision Trees were prone to overfitting. I mitigated this issue using hyperparameter tuning and simpler models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, which provided better generalization.

3. **Manual Testing Challenges:**  
   Handling unstructured user input required refining the text-cleaning process to ensure accurate predictions.
